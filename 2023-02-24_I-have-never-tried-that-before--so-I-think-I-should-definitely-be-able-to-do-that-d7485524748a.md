### …and then I fall face-first into the mud.

I wipe the mud off my face. That wasn’t nearly as easy as I had predicted. Let’s try a different angle.

I continue to waste several hours trying. Eventually, I give up. Let’s take a night’s rest and fail all again tomorrow.

The quote in the title is taken from Pippi Longstocking, a silly children's book. I heard it being mentioned several times in my corporate journey, and it stuck with me. It's such an important attitude because it sets you up for failure. And failure is the best way to learn.

Countless times have I spent many hours trying to solve problems that were, in retrospect, probably far beyond my reach. I give up. It feels like a waste of time. But usually, later, I reencounter the same problem, or it is mentioned in a social context. Having internalized the problem, I can use my knowledge in similar domains.

You only improve yourself by getting your hands dirty. You will hardly learn if you don't let a problem drive you to the brink of madness, allowing it to overconsume you to the point where you cannot stop thinking about it. In the shower, while commuting, and it even keeps you awake in bed.

'Never again,' says the closed mindset.

'All day, every day,' says the growth mindset.

Find those places where your mind dares not venture. For me, as a Software Engineer, it was the field of AI. With a lot of banging my head against walls this week, I finally finished my first language model.

So, what topics get your head spinning just thinking about them?

Get ready to fail!
