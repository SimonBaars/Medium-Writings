For every article I write, I scrap at least one more. Usually because I love writing about touchy subjects, but then don't want to attach it to my online identity. But also sometimes just because I'm not quite able to make the point I was aiming to make.

Anyway, if there's anything that I choose to scrap but still deem "safe to post" without being cancelled into oblivion, I'll put it here. Feedback is always welcome.
