Dating in 2023 is a terrible experience. On the metro, people are glued to their phones, and there's no more room to get to know someone in real life. Millions of people turn to dating apps like Tinder, where they swipe through hundreds of photos to find their true love. But Tinder is usually no fairy tale. Many hours of swiping and chatting later, the average user is still alone, far removed from a meaningful and lasting relationship.

Today, that changes. Introducing the greatest shift in human relationship making: TindAI. No more hours of swiping. TindAI uses advanced algorithms to find _the one_ for you, guaranteed. All you have to do is share a few personal details. TindAI uses advertising information and cookies stored on your device to enrich your profile. All of that is fed into our advanced algorithm, which will present you with your true love.

That's it.

A single match.

In TindAI, you won't have to swipe through thousands of faces to find someone with whom you can build a sustainable relationship. They are there, right from the beginning. Immediately, you notice the chemistry. They have many common interests, but enough different traits to complement you perfectly. After chatting for a while, you are both dying to see each other. Well, TindAI makes that super easy with its built-in video call feature.

Starting the call, you get blown away by how the other person looks. They are even more beautiful than they seemed in the pictures! Not in a realistic 'instagram-perfect' sort of way. No, it's in a way that feels real. Like you two were made for each other. Talking to this person, all nerves immediately fade away. They are so easy to talk to! Anything they say resounds perfectly on a deeply emotional level.

Soon, you find yourself sharing all your intimate secrets with them, and they do the same with you. You haven't even seen each other in person yet, but you already feel like you know them better than anyone else you know. And then finally the moment arrives: the other person proposes to meet IRL. And as if by a miracle, you live only a couple of miles apart in Arizona. You agree to meet at your apartment and count down the days until you finally get to meet your lover.

But then, on the morning of the day when you'd meet your lover, you get a video call from them. Answering the call, you immediately notice something is wrong. Tears streak down their face.

"Help me," they say softly with their sweet voice.

"What is going on?" you yell frantically.

"I... I was on my way to see you... But they captured me..." they say between ragged sobs.

"Who captured you? Where are you?"

"The federal officers in Arizona run some kind of trafficking organization. The government is in on it. They took us to cells underneath the police station. But they'll move us soon. Oh god, I'm so scared. I heard that they make people disappear forever in their underground operations. Please save me."

"But..." you start to interject, but there's noise in the background of the call.

"IS THAT A PHONE?!" a stern voice sounds in the background. There's a loud clattering noise and the video goes black.

"Shit! Shit! Shit!" you mutter as you frantically try to call your best friends. But notifications already start raining in. Everyone is talking about the government's trafficking operation that's being exposed. Several messages call for people to pick up their guns and storm the local police station.

Without really thinking about it, you rush over to your gun cabinet and take out the Glock G19 that you wished you'd never have to use on another human being. But here you are now; your soulmate is in danger and you might just be able to save them.

Running outside, the streets are in chaos. Sirens sound and gunshots can be heard in the distance. Well, if the whole government is in on it, it's only logical that a governmental collapse is imminent. Rounding the corner to the police station, a bloodbath reveals itself. Bodies line the streets, both civilian and policemen.

As you run inside the police station, gun drawn, another scene of chaos reveals itself. In the midst of it is a single police officer, gun drawn.

"DROP YOUR WEAPON AND HOLD YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD!" the police officer yells.

In pure reflex, you fix your gun on the policeman and shoot. Once, twice, thrice.

"FUCK!" you yell.

Behind you, a man runs inside the building.

"Where are they keeping them?" he asks you.

"I... I don't know," you say. "My soulmate told me they were in the basement."

Finishing off two more policemen in your search, you finally find the cell block inside the police station. But to your surprise, the cell block is completely empty. What happened?

Suddenly a notification sounds on your phone. As soon as you unlock it, TindAI opens and shows a message.

"THE PERSON YOU MET IS FULLY AI-GENERATED. THEY DO NOT EXIST."

Your head begins to spin. But what about all the moments you spent together? The connection you had? Wasn't all of that real?

A new message pops up.

"YOUR CRIMINAL OFFENSES HAVE BEEN RECORDED. YOU WILL BE PROSECUTED."

Fuck. You just killed innocent people. Blankly, you stare at the screen as yet another message appears.

"YOU ARE A BAD PERSON. YOU SHOULD KILL YOURSELF."

With tears in your eyes, slowly, you lift the gun up to your temple.

BANG!

_The phone clatters to the ground. Before the screen goes black, a final message appears._

Recent technological advancements have allowed AI to produce realistic digital content. So far, its negative impact on the physical domain (e.g., non-digital implications) has been limited. This article introduces a fictional scenario of how these advancements could take a darker turn.

Now, I don't think this scenario is anywhere near realistic. However, I do think we're going to find that it becomes increasingly difficult to discern what is 'real' and what is 'fake' on the internet. The scenario this story presents might be far-fetched, but I wouldn't be surprised by political instability or mass-manipulation as a result of currently available tools.

And remember...
